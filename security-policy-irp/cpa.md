#### Your California Privacy Rights.

California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.

### _**California Consumer Privacy Act**_

The_California Consumer Privacy Act_(“**CCPA**”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “**Personal Information**,” as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information.

The CCPA defines “**Personal Information**” to mean “_information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household_.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a specific federal privacy law, such as the_Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act_, the_Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act_, or the_Fair Credit Reporting Act_. Your rights are described below:
