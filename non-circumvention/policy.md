# Non-Circumvention

This Section 12 discusses your agreement to make and receive payments only through Goodlawyer for two years from the date you first meet your Client or Lawyer on the Site, unless you pay a Disintermediation Fee, as detailed below.

#### Payments Through the Platform

You acknowledge and agree that (a) Goodlawyer used a substantial amount of labour and effort to develop our Platform to enable Clients to conveniently and transparently hire Lawyers online and (b) a substantial portion of the compensation Goodlawyer receives for making the Platform available to Users is collected through the Service Fees described in these Terms.

We only receive a Service Fee when a Client and a Lawyer pay and receive payment through the Platform. Therefore, for the later of (i) 24 months from the time you identify or are identified by any party through the Platform or (ii) the duration of the Legal Services Contract or Job created through introduction or discovery on the Platform (the “Non-Circumvention Period”), you agree to use the Platform as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for Legal Services directly or indirectly with that Lawyer or Client or arising out of your relationship with that party facilitated by Goodlawyer (the “Goodlawyer Relationship”).

For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the Organization you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another party through the Platform, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Platform, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Platform as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.

You agree not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered by the Platform. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to:

1. submit Quotes or solicit Clients identified through the Platform to contract, hire, work with, or pay outside the Platform;

2. accept Quotes or solicit Lawyers identified through the Platform to contract, invoice, or receive payment outside the Site;

3. invoice or report on the Platform or in an Opt-Out Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed between the Users; or

4. refer a User you identified on the Platform to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments off the Site.

You agree to notify Goodlawyer immediately if a person suggests to you making or receiving payments outside of the Platform in violation of this Section. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention agreement, please submit a confidential report to Goodlawyer by sending an email message to: help@goodlawyer.ca.

#### Circumvention Policy and Fees

If a Client solicits a Lawyer to take the Goodlawyer Relationship off of the Platform and make payment for Legal Services other than in accordance with Section 12.1, then the Client agrees to pay a one-time fee (the “**Disintermediation Fee**”) equal to the greater of: (i) $2,500, or (ii) 50% the amount actually paid by the Client to the Lawyer for Legal Services for which payment was processed other than through the Platform and (iii) 50% of the amount of a Quote provided by a Lawyer to the Client on the Platform, which may be through a custom Quote or the amount of a Fixed-Fee Listing.

If a Lawyer obtains a request for a Job or is otherwise identified by a Client through the Platform, and the Lawyer solicits the Client to make payment other than in accordance with Section 12.1, to make payment for Legal Services originated through a Goodlawyer Relationship, then the Lawyer agrees to pay a Disintermediation Fee to the Company of $5,000.

Recruiting from Platform

If any Client agrees to hire a Lawyer as a full-time employee following their introduction to that Lawyer through the Goodlawyer Platform, the Client agrees it will pay the Company a recruitment fee equal to the greater of: (i) $5,000 or (ii) 15% of the Lawyer’s first-year employment salary.

### Reviews, Ratings, Comments and Other Content

Within a certain timeframe after obtaining Legal Services, Clients can leave a public review (a “Review”) and submit a star rating (a “Rating”) about the Lawyer that they worked with. Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinions and experiences of individual Clients and do not reflect the opinion of Goodlawyer about any Hand may be incorrect or misleading.

Ratings and Reviews by Clients of Lawyers must be truthful, accurate and may not contain any offensive or defamatory language. Ratings and Reviews are subject to Section 9 (User-Generated Content) and must comply with our policies. As legal matters are sensitive, any Review and Rating should be solely based on the Client’s experience working with the Lawyer and not based on the particular outcome of a given situation.

Users are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party to write a positive or negative Review about another Lawyer. Ratings and Reviews are part of a Lawyer’s public profile and may also be surfaced elsewhere on the Goodlawyer Platform (such as the any Fixed-Fee Listings) together with other relevant information such as number of jobs, number of cancellations, average response time and other information.

### Electronic Communications

In connection with the Terms of Service, you may be entitled to receive certain records from Goodlawyer or our Affiliates, such as contracts, notices, and communications, in writing. To facilitate your use of the Platform and the Platform Services, you give us permission to provide these records to you electronically instead of in paper form.

### Right to Refuse

You acknowledge that Goodlawyer reserves the right to refuse service to anyone and to cancel User access at any time, subject to any restrictions under applicable law.

### Term and Termination

#### Termination

This Section discusses your and our agreement about when and how long this Agreement will last, when and how either you or Goodlawyer can end this Agreement, and what happens if either of us ends the Agreement, as detailed below.

Unless both you and Goodlawyer expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided herein. You may provide written notice to [help@goodlawyer.ca](help@goodlawyer.ca). In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Platform and Platform Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed. Goodlawyer is not a party to any Legal Services Contract between Users. Consequently, you understand and acknowledge that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Legal Services Contract or Job entered into between Users. If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Jobs, you agree: (a) you hereby instruct Goodlawyer to close any open contracts; (b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Jobs have closed on the Platform; (c) Goodlawyer will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Job or related transaction between you and another User; and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Legal Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Goodlawyer for any Platform Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Lawyers for any Legal Services.

Without limiting our other rights or remedies, we may, but are not obligated to, temporarily or indefinitely revoke access to the Platform or Platform Services, deny your registration, or permanently revoke your access to the Platform and refuse to provide any or all Platform Services to you if: (i) you breach the letter or spirit of any terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other provisions of the Terms of Service; (ii) we suspect or become aware that you have provided false or misleading information to us; or (iii) we believe, in our sole discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users, or Goodlawyer or our Affiliates; may be contrary to the interests of the Platform or the User community; or may involve illicit or illegal activity. If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Platform under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account without Goodlawyer’s prior written consent. If you attempt to use the Platform under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available payment method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.

You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Platform depend on transparency of User’s Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Legal Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree as follows:

**IF GOODLAWYER DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO LEGAL SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT CLOSURE. YOU AGREE THAT GOODLAWYER WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY USER REGARDING CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE.**

#### Account Data

Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, or other material you keep on the Platform and that that any closure of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which Goodlawyer will have no liability whatsoever. The Company, in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law, may retain some or all of your Account information.

##### Survival

After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or Goodlawyer from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.

### Disputes and Dispute Resolution

Section 18 discusses your agreement with Goodlawyer and our agreement with you about how we will resolve any disputes, including that we will both first try to resolve any dispute informally and that we both agree to use arbitration instead of going to court or using a jury if we can’t resolve the dispute informally, as detailed below.

##### Disputes between Goodlawyer and Platform Users

If a dispute arises between you and Goodlawyer or our Affiliates, our goal is to resolve the dispute quickly, cost-effectively, and in a friendly manner. Accordingly, unless you opt out as provided in Section 18.9 below, you, Goodlawyer, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy that arises out of or relates to this Agreement, the other Terms of Service, your relationship with Goodlawyer (including without limitation any claimed employment with Goodlawyer or one of our Affiliates or successors), the termination of your relationship with Goodlawyer, or the Platform Services (in this Section 18 each, a “Claim”) in accordance with this Section 18 (sometimes referred to as the “Arbitration Provision”).

##### Scope of Claims

Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Terms of Service, any Legal Services Contract, payments or agreements, any payments or monies you claim are due to you from the Company or our Affiliates or successors, trade secrets, unfair competition, false advertising, consumer protection, privacy, compensation, classification, minimum wage, seating, expense reimbursement, overtime, breaks and rest periods, termination, discrimination, retaliation or harassment and claims arising under and all legislated provincial, state or federal claims arising out of or relating to your relationship with Goodlawyer or the termination of that relationship.

##### Choice of Law

These Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta.

##### Informal Dispute Resolution

Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, you agree with the Company to first notify each other of the Claim or potential Claim. You agree to notify Goodlawyer of the Claim at by email to [help@goodlawyer.ca](help@goodlawyer.ca), and the Company agrees to provide to you a notice at your email address on file (in each case, a “Notice”). You and the Company then will seek informal voluntary resolution of the Claim. Any Notice must include pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and contact information, so that you or Goodlawyer, as applicable, may evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve the Claim. Both you and the Company will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim, which, if successful, will avoid the need for further action.

##### Binding Arbitration and Waiver

This Arbitration Provision applies to all Users. In the unlikely event the parties are unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of the receipt of the applicable Notice, you, the Company, and our Affiliates (if applicable) agree to resolve the Claim by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator selected by the Company instead of a court or jury.

##### Scope, Place and Rules of Arbitration Agreement

This Arbitration Provision applies to any Claim (defined above) the parties may have and survives after your relationship with Goodlawyer ends. Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Terms of Service. This Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of any disputes arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Service that otherwise would be resolved in a provincial or federal court of law or before a forum other than arbitration.

Except as otherwise provided herein, arbitration will be conducted in Calgary, Alberta. Arbitration of disputes brought by a User that allege a violation of a consumer protection statute also will be subject to this Arbitration Provision, and such arbitration will be conducted in accordance with this Agreement. The applicable. Any dispute regarding the applicability of a particular set of rules shall be resolved exclusively by the arbitrator. Any party will have the right to appear at the arbitration by telephone and/or video rather than in person.

You and the Company will follow the applicable arbitration rules with respect to arbitration fees. In any arbitration with a Lawyer, the Lawyer will pay arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, with Goodlawyer to make up the difference, if any. In any arbitration in which a User makes a claim under a consumer protection statute, the User will pay arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, or $250.00, whichever is less, with Goodlawyer to make up the difference, if any. The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no amendment to this Arbitration Provision will apply to any matter pending in an arbitration proceeding brought under this Section 18 unless all parties to that arbitration consent in writing to that amendment.

##### Enforcement and Interpretation

This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision covers, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court. The parties expressly agree that the arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration Provision, this Agreement, or any other part of the Terms of Service is void or voidable.

In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. If any portion of the Class Action Waiver below of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, you and Goodlawyer agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

##### Class Action Waiver

Both you and the Company agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (the “Class Action Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the applicable arbitration rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which:

1. The dispute is filed as a class or collective action; and,

2. There is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. 
   
   1. You and Goodlawyer agree that you will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of your filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum. However, we may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.

##### Opt-Out of Arbitration Provision

You may opt out of the Arbitration Provision contained in this Page by notifying Goodlawyer in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the Platform. To opt out, you must send a written notification to the Company that includes (a) your Account username, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address, and (f) a statement indicating that you wish to opt out of the Arbitration Provision. This written notification may be sent to [help@goodlawyer.ca](help@goodlawyer.ca). Opting out of this Arbitration Provision will not affect any other terms of this Agreement.

If you do not opt out as provided in this Section 18.9, continuing your relationship with Goodlawyer constitutes mutual acceptance of the terms of this Arbitration Provision by you and the Company. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Agreement and the Arbitration Provision.
