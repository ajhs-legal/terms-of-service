## Term and Termination

#### Termination

###### This Section discusses your and our agreement about when and how long this Agreement will last, when and how either you or Goodlawyer can end this Agreement, and what happens if either of us ends the Agreement, as detailed below.

Unless both you and Goodlawyer expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided herein. You may provide written notice to [help@goodlawyer.ca](help@goodlawyer.ca). 

In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Platform and Platform Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed. Goodlawyer is not a party to any Legal Services Contract between Users. Consequently, you understand and acknowledge that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Legal Services Contract or Job entered into between Users. 

##### Undertakings of Goodlawyer

If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Jobs, you agree:
1. You hereby instruct Goodlawyer to close any open contracts; 
2. You will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Jobs have closed on the Platform;
3. Goodlawyer will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Job or related transaction between you and another User; and,
1. You will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Legal Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Goodlawyer for any Platform Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Lawyers for any Legal Services.

##### Goodlawyer Remedies

Without limiting our other rights or remedies, we may, but are not obligated to, temporarily or indefinitely revoke access to the Platform or Platform Services, deny your registration, or permanently revoke your access to the Platform and refuse to provide any or all Platform Services to you if: 
1. You breach the letter or spirit of any terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other provisions of the Terms of Service;
2. We suspect or become aware that you have provided false or misleading information to us; or, 
3.  We believe, in our sole and absolute discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users, or Goodlawyer or our Affiliates; may be contrary to the interests of the Platform or the User community; or may involve illicit or illegal activity. 

**If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Platform under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account without Goodlawyer’s prior written consent.** If you attempt to use the Platform under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available payment method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.

You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Platform depend on transparency of User’s Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Legal Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree as follows:

**IF GOODLAWYER DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO LEGAL SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT CLOSURE. YOU AGREE THAT GOODLAWYER WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY USER REGARDING CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE.**

#### Account Data

Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, or other material you keep on the Platform and that that any closure of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which Goodlawyer will have no liability whatsoever. The Company, in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law, may retain some or all of your Account information.

#### Survival

After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates. 

**Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or Goodlawyer from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.**
