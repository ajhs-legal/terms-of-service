# Disputes and Dispute Resolution

## This Section discusses your agreement with Goodlawyer and our agreement with you about how we will resolve any disputes, including that we will both first try to resolve any dispute informally and that we both agree to use arbitration instead of going to court or using a jury if we can’t resolve the dispute informally, as detailed below.


## Disputes between Goodlawyer and Platform Users

If a dispute arises between you and Goodlawyer or our Affiliates, **our goal is to resolve the dispute quickly, cost-effectively, and in a friendly manner.**

Accordingly, you, Goodlawyer, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy that arises out of your relationship with Goodlawyer (including without limitation any claimed employment with Goodlawyer or one of our Affiliates or successors), the termination of your relationship with Goodlawyer, or the Platform Services (in this Section each, a “**Claim**”) in accordance with this Section (sometimes referred to as the “**Arbitration Provision**”).

## Scope of Claims

Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Terms of Service, any Legal Services Contract, payments or agreements, any payments or monies you claim are due to you from the Company or our Affiliates or successors, trade secrets, unfair competition, false advertising, consumer protection, privacy, compensation, classification, minimum wage, seating, expense reimbursement, overtime, breaks and rest periods, termination, discrimination, retaliation or harassment and claims arising under and all legislated provincial, state or federal claims arising out of or relating to your relationship with Goodlawyer or the termination of that relationship.

## Choice of Law

These Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta.

## Informal Dispute Resolution

Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, you agree with the Company to first notify each other of the Claim or potential Claim. You agree to notify Goodlawyer of the Claim at by email to [help@goodlawyer.ca](help@goodlawyer.ca), and the Company agrees to provide to you a notice at your email address on file (in each case, a “**Notice**”). You and the Company then will seek informal voluntary resolution of the Claim. Any Notice must include pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and contact information, so that you or Goodlawyer, as applicable, may evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve the Claim. Both you and the Company will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim, which, if successful, will avoid the need for further action.

## Binding Arbitration and Waiver

This Arbitration Provision applies to all Users. In the unlikely event the parties are unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of the receipt of the applicable Notice, you, the Company, and our Affiliates (if applicable) agree to resolve the Claim by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator selected by the Company instead of a court or jury.

# Scope, Place and Rules of Arbitration Agreement

This Arbitration Provision applies to any Claim (defined above) the parties may have and survives after your relationship with Goodlawyer ends. Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Terms of Service. This Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of any disputes arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Service that otherwise would be resolved in a provincial or federal court of law or before a forum other than arbitration.

Except as otherwise provided herein, arbitration will be conducted in Calgary, Alberta. Arbitration of disputes brought by a User that allege a violation of a consumer protection statute also will be subject to this Arbitration Provision, and such arbitration will be conducted in accordance with this Agreement. The applicable. Any dispute regarding the applicability of a particular set of rules shall be resolved exclusively by the arbitrator. Any party will have the right to appear at the arbitration by telephone and/or video rather than in person.

You and the Company will follow the applicable arbitration rules with respect to arbitration fees. In any arbitration with a Lawyer, the Lawyer will pay arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, with Goodlawyer to make up the difference, if any. In any arbitration in which a User makes a claim under a consumer protection statute, the User will pay arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, or $250.00, whichever is less, with Goodlawyer to make up the difference, if any. The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no amendment to this Arbitration Provision will apply to any matter pending in an arbitration proceeding brought under this Section unless all parties to that arbitration consent in writing to that amendment.

### Enforcement and Interpretation

This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision covers, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court. The parties expressly agree that the arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration Provision, this Agreement, or any other part of the Terms of Service is void or voidable.

In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. If any portion of the Class Action Waiver below of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, you and Goodlawyer agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

### Class Action Waiver

Both you and the Company agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (the “Class Action Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the applicable arbitration rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which:

1. The dispute is filed as a class or collective action; and,
2. There is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. 
   1. You and Goodlawyer agree that you will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of your filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum. However, we may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.

### Opt-Out of Arbitration Provision

You may opt out of the Arbitration Provision contained in this Page by notifying Goodlawyer in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the Platform.

This written notification may be sent to [help@goodlawyer.ca](help@goodlawyer.ca). Opting out of this Arbitration Provision will not affect any other terms of this Agreement.

If you do not opt out as provided in this Section, continuing your relationship with Goodlawyer constitutes mutual acceptance of the terms of this Arbitration Provision by you and the Company. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Agreement and the Arbitration Provision.
