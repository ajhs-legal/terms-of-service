# Non-Circumvention

This Section 12 discusses your agreement to make and receive payments only through Goodlawyer for two years from the date you first meet your Client or Lawyer on the Site, unless you pay a Disintermediation Fee, as detailed below.

#### Payments Through the Platform

You acknowledge and agree that (a) Goodlawyer used a substantial amount of labour and effort to develop our Platform to enable Clients to conveniently and transparently hire Lawyers online and (b) a substantial portion of the compensation Goodlawyer receives for making the Platform available to Users is collected through the Service Fees described in these Terms.

We only receive a Service Fee when a Client and a Lawyer pay and receive payment through the Platform. Therefore, for the later of (i) 24 months from the time you identify or are identified by any party through the Platform or (ii) the duration of the Legal Services Contract or Job created through introduction or discovery on the Platform (the “Non-Circumvention Period”), you agree to use the Platform as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for Legal Services directly or indirectly with that Lawyer or Client or arising out of your relationship with that party facilitated by Goodlawyer (the “Goodlawyer Relationship”).

For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the Organization you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another party through the Platform, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Platform, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Platform as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.

You agree not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered by the Platform. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to:

1. submit Quotes or solicit Clients identified through the Platform to contract, hire, work with, or pay outside the Platform;

2. accept Quotes or solicit Lawyers identified through the Platform to contract, invoice, or receive payment outside the Site;

3. invoice or report on the Platform or in an Opt-Out Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed between the Users; or

4. refer a User you identified on the Platform to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments off the Site.

You agree to notify Goodlawyer immediately if a person suggests to you making or receiving payments outside of the Platform in violation of this Section. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention agreement, please submit a confidential report to Goodlawyer by sending an email message to: help@goodlawyer.ca.

#### Circumvention Policy and Fees

If a Client solicits a Lawyer to take the Goodlawyer Relationship off of the Platform and make payment for Legal Services other than in accordance with Section 12.1, then the Client agrees to pay a one-time fee (the “**Disintermediation Fee**”) equal to the greater of: (i) $2,500, or (ii) 50% the amount actually paid by the Client to the Lawyer for Legal Services for which payment was processed other than through the Platform and (iii) 50% of the amount of a Quote provided by a Lawyer to the Client on the Platform, which may be through a custom Quote or the amount of a Fixed-Fee Listing.

If a Lawyer obtains a request for a Job or is otherwise identified by a Client through the Platform, and the Lawyer solicits the Client to make payment other than in accordance with Section 12.1, to make payment for Legal Services originated through a Goodlawyer Relationship, then the Lawyer agrees to pay a Disintermediation Fee to the Company of $5,000.

### Recruiting from Platform

If any Client agrees to hire a Lawyer as a full-time employee following their introduction to that Lawyer through the Goodlawyer Platform, the Client agrees it will pay the Company a recruitment fee equal to the greater of: (i) $5,000 or (ii) 15% of the Lawyer’s first-year employment salary.

### Reviews, Ratings, Comments and Other Content

Within a certain timeframe after obtaining Legal Services, Clients can leave a public review (a “Review”) and submit a star rating (a “Rating”) about the Lawyer that they worked with. Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinions and experiences of individual Clients and do not reflect the opinion of Goodlawyer about any Hand may be incorrect or misleading.

Ratings and Reviews by Clients of Lawyers must be truthful, accurate and may not contain any offensive or defamatory language. Ratings and Reviews are subject to Section 9 (User-Generated Content) and must comply with our policies. As legal matters are sensitive, any Review and Rating should be solely based on the Client’s experience working with the Lawyer and not based on the particular outcome of a given situation.

Users are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party to write a positive or negative Review about another Lawyer. Ratings and Reviews are part of a Lawyer’s public profile and may also be surfaced elsewhere on the Goodlawyer Platform (such as the any Fixed-Fee Listings) together with other relevant information such as number of jobs, number of cancellations, average response time and other information.

### Electronic Communications

In connection with the Terms of Service, you may be entitled to receive certain records from Goodlawyer or our Affiliates, such as contracts, notices, and communications, in writing. To facilitate your use of the Platform and the Platform Services, you give us permission to provide these records to you electronically instead of in paper form.

### Right to Refuse

You acknowledge that Goodlawyer reserves the right to refuse service to anyone and to cancel User access at any time, subject to any restrictions under applicable law.
